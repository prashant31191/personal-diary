Personal Diary
==============
This is an Android app for archiving day to day activities in the form of notes. We can add pictures to each note and also color code them. The app can be downloaded from the [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rahul.pDiary). This was initially written in 2011 when I was new to Android and hence the code is cluttered and not easy to read. Any contributions or clean up is welcome.
